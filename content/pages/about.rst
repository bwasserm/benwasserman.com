About
#####

I'm a Masters Electical and Computer Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University. I'll be graduating in December, and moving to LA where I will begin work building rockets at SpaceX.

At CMU, I spend my time doing too many things (a second major in Student Activities some call it).
