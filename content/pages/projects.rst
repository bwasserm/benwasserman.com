Here are some projects I worked on at CMU.

Astrobotic_

Astrobotic is attempting to put a robot on the moon as part of the competition for the Google Lunar X Prize. I helped with some systems in the Red Rover prototype.

Colony is a Roboclub project, working to build and use a swarm of low cost robots.
